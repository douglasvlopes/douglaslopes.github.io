summary:    How the digital fabrication is changing the disign process in Architecture.
---

  Architects always needed a design process to sucessfully get to the expected final result and as part of this process they always 
  had two main tools: drawings and models. Some years ago an Architect would choose to begin a project with a drawing or a model,
  and probably would alternate between these tools during this design process, this decision is no longer needed.
  In the last decade these tools were developed and changed a lot because of new technologies which made this process get faster and more dynamic, 
  and made possible to the drawing and model be made at the same time through a digital model. Revit is an example of a new "tool" for architecture.

  Even though a digital model is really usefull, it can't substitute a phisical model. So, how to quickly make a precise phisical model 
  directly through digital drawings? 3D Printers can print achitectural models with a high level of precision, detail and complex shapes,
  which would take a long time and a lot of patience to be hand made in a lower quality.

  But now the question is: How to make phisical printed models be part of the concept of the project and not just the printed version
  of a digital model? How to make this part of design process as a whole? There is a lot of solutions for that, 3D printers can be modified
  or programmed to have the same function of a sketch drawing or serve as inspiration to define the shape of a building. 
  In the following example, robots are used to push and pull some kind of bungees changing the original shape of them..

  This research will explore some possibilities for the use of these technologies as inspiration and concept base for architecure projects.
  These technologies are something new which has been developed very fast, so it's important to architects to be ready to make the most of
  what it can offer.
